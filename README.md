ðŸ“ŒAbout Us

The group of Prof. Rasulev is focused on development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictive models to design novel polymeric materials, nanomaterials and to predict their various properties, 
including toxicity, solubility, fouling release properties, elasticity, degradation rate, biodegradation, etc. 
The group applies computational chemistry, machine learning and cheminformatics methods for modeling, data analysis and development of predictive structure-property relationship models 
to find structural factors responsible for activity of investigated materials.

**A ML predictor for Rotifer species toxicity in Salt and Fresh Water**

**It is a free web-application for Fresh and Fresh Water Toxicity Prediction against Rotifers**



The Rotifer ML predictor is a Web App that use MLR regression models to predict the salt and fresh water toxicity using a Rotifer species as a target.
